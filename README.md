## Project Selene

Have been working on this Project for a while. Finally put some work in for Syntax Error '24 Hackathon :D

The web application accepts any Lunar image captured by Chandrayaan-2's OHRC (Orbital High Resolution Camera), extracts the pixel brightness to plot a 3D Lunar Map.
This idea can be polished and used in Space Programs for more efficient navigation and/or in EdTech domain, both of which we're passionate about!

For now though, this was a fabulous project to work upon in order to learn many technologies used here such as Flask, Jinja, Three.js, NumPy, Pillow (PIL) and more. And this is just the beginning ðŸ’ª.

## How to run

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
in IDE

### 3. Access the app at the following URL

```

### 4. Samples

To work with, I've provided certain sample images. You can access the complete dataset from https://pradan.issdc.gov.in/ch2/protected/browse.xhtml?id=ohrc
